/*
 * build.gradle - gradle build file for forge mod projects
 *
 *    I intend, eventually, to expand support; including multi-project builds, however, for the
 *    time being the intent is simply to provide a simple way to take existing mod projects (or
 *    to create new ones, to be distributed via, e.g. git.
 *
 *    Note that the intent is also to make use external configuration in order to allow this file
 *    to remain the same for various projects; if you want to contribute to the project, please
 *    keep that in mind. I still have not done most of the legwork necessary to make a complex
 *    build possible this way. for now, a simple build seems to be working.

/*
 * to use this project, run the following commands; with 'gradlew' if you want to use gradle

 * to clean the project (optional, not necessary on initial builds):
 *     gradlew clean cleanCache
 *
 * setup Minecraft decompilation workspace, where necessary (ok to try without; use if failed):
 *     gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refreshDependencies
 *
 * to build (build output will be in 'build/libs'):
 *     gradlew build

 * to setup for development:
 *     gradlew setupDevWorkspace

/*
 * thank You!
 * 
 * this configuration is fairly generic and more-or-less relies on gradle standard configuration
 * locations; however, in addition to the gradle web help, I also learned from and took a few of
 * the configuration items from build.gradle files from the following ForgeGradle-based projects:
 * ExtrabiomesXL, BattleGear 2, Cauldron, and Forge/ForgeGradle. 
 *
 * I do not believe any of what is contained here rises to the level of taking creative content 
 * from any of those projects' respective authors, due to the limited nature of this build, and the
 * limited nature of the commands that can be used to attain the desired results, although I am 
 * willing to revisit it if any of the authors of the aforementioned projects wishes me to do so.
